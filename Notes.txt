Notes:
1. Don't do modal imputation. Probabilistic imputation, https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html
2. 'style in sentences' - using asterisks and so on, Words per sentence, number of punctuation marks, run-on sentences for feature generation
3. Localized imputation, missing indicator along with 'Unknown' value 
4. Lemmatization might get rid of the cultural differences in text, in which case stemming might be better
5. Use shapley values to show feature importance
6. Feature importance with permutation - https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/feature-importance.html

5. Sentiment analysis - job postings should have a warm/positive tone.
Test hypothesis whether there is difference in tone between fraud and non-fraud. Fraud should be higher as per intuition.

6. Use LSTM NNs
